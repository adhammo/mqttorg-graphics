## MQTT Logo - 2020 

This repository contains a collection of graphics used on the http://mqtt.org website.

Each icon available for bright and dark backgrounds in the following formats:

* [svg](/svg)
* [jpg](/jpg)
* [eps](/eps)

These graphics are free to use in presentations and on websites etc. When referring to MQTT 
as a community or protocol - where possible please link them back to the mqtt.org community 
site homepage.

Feel free to use these graphics to indicate use of or support of the MQTT protocol in your 
product, but do not use them to suggest endorsement from the community or any standards body.

We encourage individual software and hardware projects to create their own logos - you are 
welcome to create derivative works.

## Archive of earlier MQTT Logos

The [archive folder](/archive) contains early 1999 versions of the MQTT logo. This is meant as a backup. Feel free to use these graphics for historical reference. For every other application, we encourage you to use the current logo.
